## Test Execution Notes

### Environment
- **Browser(s)**: [Chrome 120, Firefox 121, Safari 17]
- **Screen Reader**: [NVDA 2024.1 / VoiceOver / JAWS]
- **OS**: [Windows 11 / macOS 14 / Linux]
- **Application URL**: [http://localhost:8080/tasks]

### Failures Detected
[If any tests fail, document here:]

**Example**:
> **Test**: T3 validation error SR (HTMX, NVDA)
> **Result**: Fail
> **Issue**: Error div added `role="alert"` but NVDA did not announce. Investigation: missing `aria-live="assertive"`.
> **Fix applied**: Commit abc123f - added `aria-live="assertive"` to error div.
> **Retest**: Pass (NVDA now announces "Title is required" immediately)

### Re-tests Required
- [ ] [Test name] - Reason: [Fix applied, needs verification]
